Here's where you can find my comments on you work as you progress...always look for the comments.md file :)

Generally, great job cloning the resume site. The only thing I noticed you missed was the bar below the resume link just under the "Wendy G. Bite" header. you can do this by adding a div with a thick border (probably 2px), or adding an hr element (the first option is generally better as hr is depricated). 

I only have 2 other comments. First, are you planning to do anything with resume.html? Its a good idea to keep projects separate and making that clear with folder and file names. The second point is just to clean up the white space and indentation in your files for clear visiual organization.

Keep up the good work!
