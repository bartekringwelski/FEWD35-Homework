Great start on this week's assignment. The grid system you're putting in place is shaping up, and the styles applied to the page look like original so far.

A few notes:
  1) It will help if you separate each part of the page clearly in your index.html and style.css files. For example, create a section for the navigation bar **in the body**, add classes and ids related to the nav bar in ways that make sense to you. Doing this for each "part" of a page will make it more manageable and readable. Try doing this to control the spacing between your menu options in the navbar.

  2) Try to use spacing in code to make parent child element relationships clear visually so its easier to read.

  3) Avoid repetition in code...I noticed in your code you repeat a lot of style choices for the same elements (e.g. h1 - h6), where you can probably apply most of them to the first section. Great job using multiple selector assignment,experimenting with em's, and importing google fonts.

  4) If you're going to use float, make sure you have a parent container with overflow: hidden, and float everything left

  That's all I have for now, keep up the good work!
